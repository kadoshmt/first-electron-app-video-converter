This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The Video Coverter Electron Application  is based on youtube tutorial of How to Code channel:

I change the state management using React ContextApi hooks instead React Redux.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

The app will reload if you make edits on react scripts.<br />
If you make edits in electron files, you will need to stop application and run yarn dev again.
